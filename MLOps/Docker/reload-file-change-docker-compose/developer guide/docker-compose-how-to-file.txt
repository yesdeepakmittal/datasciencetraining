$ docker-compose up --build     | building & running docker container

In docker-compose file, volume is to copy all files from current dir [.] to [app] dir

After running docker container, make a change to app.py file to check if reloading is working
$ docker exec -it test-docker-cont bash

Since the base OS of Python image is Debian 11, use below command to install Nano text editor to make change in app.py
$ apt update
$ apt install nano

$ nano app.py 


if you will make any change in any file and want to reload the application, install [watchfiles] and add the below arg in uvicorn command
$  uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8443 --reload --reload-include *
