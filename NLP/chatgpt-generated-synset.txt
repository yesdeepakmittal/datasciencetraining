In natural language processing (NLP), a synset (short for "synonym set") is a group of words that have a similar meaning. These words are called synonyms, and they are all considered to be interchangeable in certain contexts. For example, the words "happy," "joyful," and "delighted" might all be considered synonyms, and they would be grouped together in the same synset.

WordNet is a large lexical database of English that is used in natural language processing and computational linguistics. It groups English words into sets of synonyms called synsets, provides short, general definitions, and records the various semantic relations between these synonym sets.

The synsets are linked together by means of conceptual-semantic and lexical relations. It's simple interface to navigate through the hierarchy of word meanings. WordNet groups words into sets of synonyms called synsets and describes semantic relationships between them. Each synset provides a brief definition and also lists its member words.

For example, the word "dog" is a member of the synset "canine," which also includes words like "wolf" and "coyote." At the same time, the word "dog" is also a member of the synset "domestic_animal," which includes other words like "cat," "cow," and "sheep."

Synsets are an important tool in natural language processing and computational linguistics, as they allow algorithms to understand the similarities and relationships between words. Many NLP applications, such as natural language understanding, machine translation, and information retrieval, rely on synsets to help them understand the meaning of text.
